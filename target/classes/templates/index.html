        Virtual Interior Design is the modern way of working with a professional interior designer. All communication, moodboards, floorplans, renderings, shopping links, and other project documents are digitally delivered to your inbox.
         However, as a project progresses, in-person meetings will have to take place —<br> after all, interior design is hands-on work!
        As strange as it may sound to give a tour via Zoom or FaceTime, you will likely spend part of your consultation walking your designer from room to room so they can see your home in more detail. Jessica says, “This component of the process is very important as it allows me to see an entire view of a home and how rooms flow into each other.
